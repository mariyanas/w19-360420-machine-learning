#Error Analysis Report

Each time we run the classification model, we get a different accuracy since in lines 148-150, 
there is a new 'Random' object that is created and the data set gets shuffled.  
Still, the model's performance is pretty accurate with its results being approximately the ones below:
Accuracy mean over 1000 loops is: 0.96
Accuracy standard dev over 1000 loops is: 1.6E-4
Precision mean over 1000 loops is: 0.95
Precision standard dev over 1000 loops is: 7.5E-4
Recall mean over 1000 loops is: 0.95
Recall standard dev over 1000 loops is: 8.5E-4
We compare our model's performance with the original breast cancer data and the frequency of the
results. 

A false postive is when the data predicts that what it was searching for is present while it 
is not. Similarly, a false negative is when the data reports that there is nothing while there 
is something. These terms are most seen in binary tests such as this one.

What makes Recall and Precision different is that Recall measures the frequency of the true 
positive data found by the program according to the actual malignant data while Precision measures
the precison of the program by calculating the frequency of the true positive data divided by the
true positives and the false positives.  

These results change with the hyperparameter k since the function is locally approximated. The nearest
neighnours weigh more in the calculations than the rest of the data which makes the model even more
accurate.
